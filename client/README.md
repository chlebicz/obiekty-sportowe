# Client

Built using NextJS.

## Project setup

```bash
# installs necessary dependencies
$ npm install
```

You will also need to provide a configuration file. If you want to run both the server and the client locally, you can just rename `config-example.json` to `config.json` for now.

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development/watch mode
$ npm run dev

# build for production
$ npm run build

# run the built website
$ npm start
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run tests
```
